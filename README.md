# NeuralNetworks #

Hey there! This repository is entirely a work in progress at the moment, but my goal for this project is to create a feed-foreward neural network which has the efficiency to practically be able to identify handwritten english characters.

Of course, that's pretty far down the road, but my journey, for the most part, will be tracked here, in the form of commits. :D
